      Hello my friend, how did you happen to come here?
      It's been awhile now since I had to heal anyone
      come on inside, tell me what brought you here with a broken halo
    - |
      Come let your body rest and find a way to let go
      and lay on me the heavy burden that is on your back
      ¡No tengo miedo!
      I'll find a way to break you
      I will reach inside and take whatever kills you now
    - |
      Empty, now you seem so light that can take you
      and lay on me the subtle burden that you feel so high
      ¡Hay momentos!
      in time I'll let you break through
      I will reach inside and take whatever kills you now
    - |
      I can fell the time compressing in your halo
      and uniting everything into a single life
      inside, is bright, endless!
      covered up in ways that even you can't recognize
    - |
      Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
      In your eyes I see death now
      and uniting everything into a single life
      outside, no light, endless!
      covered up in ways that even you can't recognize
    - |
      No, no!
