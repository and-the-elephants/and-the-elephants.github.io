      Commence in three...
      I can see your maker, your maker breaks
      Commence in three...
      I can see your maker, your maker breaks
      Commence in three...
      I can see your maker as we're coming home
    - |
      This time keep reeling faster!
      Its the deceit of the century and
      I am a part of it, I'm a part of part of it you know!
      Its the deceit of the century now
      and I'm a part of, yes I'm a part of
    - |
      Listen, look ahead
      I'm on a mission to deceive
      well, somebody got me now
      listen, look ahead
      I'm on a mission to test all you lovers
      to test all your love and faith
      listen, look ahead
      I have a vision, to be sent upon us
      now there's light
      listen, look ahead
      I'm on a mission to test all you lovers
      to test all your love and faith and...
    - |
      Testify and send the fire to descend upon you sick non-believers!
    - |
      Six were before me master,
      becoming one we might suffice
      in all this growing faster
      endlessly
    - |
      Commence in three...
      I can see your maker, your maker breaks
      Commence in three...
      I can see your maker, your maker breaks
      Commence in three...
      I can see your maker,  your maker breaks
      Commencing now
      I can say is safer to lay...
