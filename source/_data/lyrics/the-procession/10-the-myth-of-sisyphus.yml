      In this practical suicide
      we have set our faith
      and ascended where the light ends
      where the life...
      In this practical suicide
      we have placed our faith
      to resent this fate in silence,
      when the life...
      In practical suicide
      we have bet our destiny
      only to get back to that place we started on
    - |
      I recognize
      this was my little leap of faith, inconsequent, desperate will to emancipate
      from this hole.
      I recognize
      I'm not brave enough, wise enough, child enough, alive enough,
      am I enough for you now my friend?
      Now we go back
      can you recognize?
      All the times we have made it
      tell me: I'm I still your friend?
      Am I myself?
    - |
      This is terrible, inconceivable,
      hiding here on my own mythical lies,
      and this is terrible, inconceivable,
      hiding here on my own mythical lies,
      but all is well,
      all is well,
      everything, everything's well.
    - |
      Henceforth,
      I decide to try it all again!
      And all is well now.
