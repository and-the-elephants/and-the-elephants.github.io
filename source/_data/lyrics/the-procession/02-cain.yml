      Every time I lie
      every time you try
      unconfined I'm wandering through the earth, hole.
    - |
      Envision my
      uncontrolled proliferation
      time can fake it all
      now, we must pray for nobody so
      our minds fall into numbed elation
      I will take you home
      we'll all soon be one
    - |
      It's coming in,
      I'm changing
      the turn of the weather and centuries
    - |
      Such a false end this has been on...Me
    - |
      Here we are down with our sins and our souls!
      No I can't go back again,
      for I'm all about bringing a little bit of our end
    - |
      Every time I die
      every time you try
      unconfined I'm wandering through the earth, hole.
    - |
      It's coming in,
      I'm changing
      the turn of the weather and centuries
    - |
      Here we are down with our sins and our souls!
      No I can't go back again,
      for I'm all about bringing a little bit of our end
