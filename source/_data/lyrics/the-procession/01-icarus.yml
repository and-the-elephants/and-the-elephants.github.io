      MY SOUL WOULD SING of metamorphoses,
      but since, oh gods, you were the cause of these
      bodies becoming other bodies,
      breathe your breath out through my voice
      so may the songs I sing be seamless as its ways
      will weave the time out through the world's BEGIN!
    - |
      And I'm falling down on this backlit shadow
      I'll enunciate so the light will follow my lead
      my tongue reaches out
      laying down logic, time is shallow
      I'll emancipate from the sky and follow my will
      high is now the end!
    - |
      Hide this signs for another!
      as I'm diving in
      reaching out behind me is a word I stutter far beyond the fall being smothered
    - |
      Wake up
      torn again, hotter
      fall back down into despair
      all the tedious shouting on my
      all the visions of high handed selfish shut eye brothers yeah wake up
      run again on air
      fall back down in one another!
    - |
      And hide this signs for another!
      as I'm diving in
      reaching out behind me is a word I stutter
      far beyond the fall being smothered
      hide this signs from my other... Brother!
      Far beyond the fall begins another end
