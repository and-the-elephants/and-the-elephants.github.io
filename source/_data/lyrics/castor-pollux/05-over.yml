      I hide in our...
    - |
      Compelling desire to break it all down
      while we try and make it look like an accident
      like we've always done it in the past
    - |
      Compensating for, what you know we will never have in mind and
      hands over me, cause this ship is sinking
      and this time,
    - |
      This is something I will have to get over
      this is something I will have to get over
      avoiding desires to make you follow me on my avidity
      cause this is something I will have to get over, by myself
    - |
      All I've ever cared about is myself
      and all I've ever cared about is myself
      and all I've ever cared about is what I can do and I can't do without
      and all I ever care about is myself
    - |
      But this is something I have tried to get over
      this is something I have tried to get over, over and over and over in the past
      but now we're finally wallowing on our empty cravings
      but this is something I won't have to get over, by myself
    - |
      Fulfilling desire to break it all down
      while we try and make it look like an accident
      like we've always done it in the past
      cause all I've ever cared about is what I can do and I can't do without
      and all I ever care about is myself
