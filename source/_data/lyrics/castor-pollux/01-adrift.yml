      All this time I've been searching for someone
      to stand outside the line if its time and reason
      and all this time you've been searching for some way
      to break and rewind
    - |
      Back in time when we used to be the ones
      who were breaking all the lines making all the reasons
      and all this time you were been breaking in front of me,
      fading further
    - |
      Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away,
      but I can see you
    - |
      I have seen you work your way out of this
      like the symptoms you're hiding out
      oh but I can see you!
    - |
      I have seen you work your way out of this
      (time and space)
      silently
      (I can see)
      you're fading
      like the symptoms you're hiding out
      oh but I can see you die
    - |
      Die, die!
      Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
