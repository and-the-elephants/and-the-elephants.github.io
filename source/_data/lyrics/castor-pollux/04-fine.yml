      Now it's time, now it's time
      unfolding right in front of us tonight
      your denial, your denial
      kept folding all around my thoughts
    - |
      But tonight
      suddenly it's clear that it's your life or mine
      so why don't you let me just go and I'll be just fine
      won't you try?
      won't you?
    - |
      This is time, now is time
      folding all around
      ticking and shrinking and
      this it's time, now it's time
      folding all around
      ticking and shrinking and
      now It's time, now it's time
      I'll lie to hide my hands grabbing the knife
      terrified, terrified
      if you had known my hand's grabbed into the knife
    - |
      Suddenly it's clear that it's your life or mine,
      so tonight, I won't try, I won't fight anything
      that has kept me from going out of your side
      won't you try, won't you try
      and let me just go and I'll be just fine
      won't you try?
      won't you?
