      I'm gonna try and fix it up again
      Not counting all the times I failed
      20 by the way
      Measuring times between each every fucking...
      While they're fucking around
      Wish they were fucking...
      Relax
      Count back
      Step aside
      Is not my time
      To be straightening hem
      or anyone else for all I care
      You know I'm not gonna make
      This my 21th fail
    - |
      It's My time. My line
      Give me my, fucking mic
      I'm gonna blow your minds
      You are stepping aside
      I'm gonna make you
      Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out
      That it's enough for now and forever now
      That its enough for now. You should get out.
      Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Out while you can.

      Wish they were fucking...
      Relax
      Count back
      Step aside
      Is not my time
      To be straightening hem
      or anyone else for all I care
      You know I'm not gonna make
      This my 21th fail

      That it's enough for now and forever now
      Now it's enough now. I should get out.
      Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out while I...
      I can't. I may. I will
      Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Out while I can.

      I'm gonna try and fix it up. I'm gonna try and fix it up
      And I will, I will, I will!
