      Don't stop take it,
      in you're eyes I'll see you fake it,
      anyway I'll make it in
    - |
      So don't stop hoping over your tethering lines,
      I only rode in your absence and
      mine was nothing but a deceptive enticement
      to leave all you're relying so
      you won't see this as your falling back on it
    - |
      Don't stop lying over your tethering hopes
      and only moan in my absence
      and all was nothing but a deception
      in my sense to hide all that your leaving so
      you won't see that all is coming back again
      take it in your hiding cause
      every time and every night I'm over now
    - |
      So don't stop take it
      in you're eyes I'll see you fake it,
      anyway I'll make it in
      but I won't break it
    - |
      Over this endless seconds of my own
      unconceivable weary ends of deception
      and I hope your ready now that I'm
      ready and getting so many of every steady line
    - |
      All that you want I already know it
      all that you need I'm already turning for
      all that you own I've already bough it
      all that you are I've already thought it for
      you're not getting back again
      I'm not turning back again
      I'm not hiding anything and
      every time and every night I'm over cause
      all that you want I'm already on it
      all that you need I have already turned it for you
