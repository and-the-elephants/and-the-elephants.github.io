      Just let me... dance around the fact
      so long for now
      pulses slide across it for a while
      helping... matters stride
      with arms apart,
      lifted un-breezed, at the dusk
      for what I care you won't
      try and make it worth
      and just dance around it for a while
    - |
      And... striding over hallow heads
      arms reach for everlasting empty hails
      to help me desensitize, to recognize
      and try not to analyze
      and hope to make it worth
      why can't we just dance and dance and dance and dance
    - |
      I'm striding not to fall apart,
      sliding nowhere to
      an empty dawn
      I'm overthrown now
      that I'm dancing all around the fact
      with nothing left to analyze
      nothing left is worth it
      all is left is to dance
      just dance
      and dance
      just dance
      and dance
      and...
