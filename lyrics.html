so long for now<br />
pulses slide across it for a while<br />
helping... matters stride<br />

lifted un-breezed, at the dusk<br />
for what I care you won't<br />
try and make it worth<br />
and just dance around it for a while<br />
</p>
      
      <p class='section'>And... striding over hallow heads<br />
arms reach for everlasting empty hails<br />
to help me desensitize, to recognize<br />
and try not to analyze<br />
and hope to make it worth<br />
why can't we just dance and dance and dance and dance<br />
</p>
      
      <p class='section'>I'm striding not to fall apart,<br />
sliding nowhere to<br />
an empty dawn<br />
I'm overthrown now<br />
that I'm dancing all around the fact<br />
with nothing left to analyze<br />
nothing left is worth it<br />
all is left is to dance<br />
just dance<br />
and dance<br />
just dance<br />
and dance<br />
and...<br />
