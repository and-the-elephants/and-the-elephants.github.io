      You just preach and let it out,
      Fight!
      Then get started again
      cause when you're reaching high enough
      you're getting used to the air, hot air
    - |
      So just get up, straight up, read a loud and make us right!
      so gotta let out, all you've got, cleanse our minds, you self-righteous fuck!
    - |
      All of your might won't stop us from fighting again
      misinformation, strait up lies in our faces just keep
      turning around on you every time
    - |
      We're gonna reach and let it out
      Fight!
      we're gonna fight you again,
      we're gonna reach and let it out
      we're gonna fight you again
      again, and thn again, and then again
    - |
      I'm getting tired of fighting all of you people
      yes I'm real tired of fighting all of you fuckers
      but I can stop fighting all of you people!
      Y si te digo no
      you better get it in time
      you just preach and let it out
      Fight
      we're gonna fight you again,
      we're gonna reach and let it out
      we're gonna fight you again
      again, and then again, and then again
