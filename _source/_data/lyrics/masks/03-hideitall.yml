      Echoes, echoes far away
      fade, and say lie
      then sell more lies
      keep faking it, like you always have
      and hide it all from all of our understanding with your never-ending
      ambitions to be paid, from decisions far away
      I hope you
      hide it all from all of their understanding and their never-ending
      ambitions to be paid, so fade and
    - |
      Hide it all, hide it all,
      thinking about your consequences
      thinking about what you left behind
      just hide it all, hide it all,
      thinking about your consequences
      thinking about what you left behind
    - |
      Echoes, there goes all again
      say,
      this time they say is not from us you have to
      hide it all with all of your understanding with your never-ending
      ambitions to be paid, from decisions far away
      so you just
      hide it all from all of their understanding with their never-ending
      ambitions to be paid, so fade and
    - |
      Hide it all, hide it all
      thinking about no consequences
      thinking about nothing left behind
      and hide it all, hide it all
      thinking about no consequences
      thinking about nothing left behind
    - |
      And hide it all, hide it all,
      thinking about your consequences
      thinking about what you left behind
      and hide it all,
      hide!
      thinking about what you left behind
