      I can see back
      we have fallen into
      blindness and violence
      endless die and kill
      dithering the way of
      silence, but violence ends now
      hiding in thy hallow name the key to end our wallowing
      the time is perfect
      so violence ends now
      hiding in thy hallow name the key to end our wallowing
      the time is perfect
      so violence ends now
      far away!
    - |
      Send to me this satellite
      got me high and lost, wild animal
      I'm in this brightness and blinded
      like cloudless sun, uncovered eyes
      now do you recall my loving lie?
      say this loudly so violence ends now
      but impatiently we let a lie
      overcome the sun and force this never ending violence
      but silence ends now
      far away!
    - |
      And far away!
      I can see you far away!
      Send to me this satellite...
      Far away
