      It's setting fast inside of me,
      foresee, beware, stop, rise or we'll never ever be apart
      empty silently apart you see,
      I am the one you thought could be
      killed, lied, deceived, to get you high as this colliding light
      reaching up no matter what but the truth...
      Is, this place, holds the false,
      rise you always dream about
      but if you, face the truth, friend you should
      yield and let me be the one
    - |
      It's late to see
      what happens every time we get to collide!
      It's late but not impossible
      wait to see
      what happens every time we get to collide!
      Wake up now you gotta go
    - |
      I am the one,
      I am the one you thought you could never ever be apart
      empty silently apart you see,
      I am the one,
      the only one who'll get you as high as this colliding light
      reaching up no matter what but the truth...
    - |
      It's late to see
      what happens every time we get to collide!
      It's late but not impossible
      wait to see
      what happens every time we get to collide!
      Wake up now you gotta go
    - |
      now you know, now you know, let go!
