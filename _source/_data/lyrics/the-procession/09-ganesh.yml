      Take, them away!
      Come take them out of my arms and out of my head
      and break, them away!
      Come take them out on my arms and out of my head
    - |
      Ways of devotion take me away
      we are the last ones you thought will be drifting away
      in the name of, in the name of faith
      in my arms, in my arms,
      In my arms!
      Just break, them away!
      Come take them out of my arms and out of my head
      and take, them away!
      Come take them out of my arms and out of my head

      I'll be gone,
      I'll be going somewhere you haven't even thought of
      I'll be gone,
      I'll be going somewhere you won't bleed
      I'll be gone,
      In some ways you haven't even thought of
      and I'll be gone in some ways you haven't even thought of!
