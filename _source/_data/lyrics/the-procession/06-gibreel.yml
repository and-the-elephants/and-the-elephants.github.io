      Coming outside of this plane, humble,
      coming inside of this plane, perfect at last
    - |
      Deep inside, deep inside
    - |
      Closing inside, I said, "This is something I don't quite recognize"
      then you threw me and tempt me away
      begged, "Please hold me, patiently, hold your flight"
    - |
      Tell me you haven't seen
      anything quite like this
      in your past creations,
      of everything, the never seen and all the wonderful visions of me and you as me
    - |
      Let me inside, let me inside, let me inside, let me inside
      look at me now, there must be something you haven't seen,
      let me inside, let me inside, let me inside, let me inside
      I'm your whole and wings
    - |
      That's what they told us
      oh yes they told me you were gone, forever
      killed your way out of here
      "Mahound, fake this murders for me"
    - |
      Coming outside of this plane, humble,
      coming inside of this plane perfect at least,
      patiently, hold your flight
    - |
      Let me inside, let me inside, let me inside, let me inside
      look at me now, there must be something you haven't seen so
      let me inside, let me inside, let me inside, let me inside
      I'm your whole and
      tell me you haven't seen,
      anything quite like this
      in your past lives
      oh you gotta fight me, gotta fight me, gotta fight me, gotta fight me,
      or I'll stay,
      or I'll kill,
      or I'll...
