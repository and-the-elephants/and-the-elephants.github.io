      Break the silence
      keep telling me your latest vice
      please tell it in a way that I can understand
    - |
      Break the silence and call it off
      as you haven't been awaken
      as you haven't been away for long
    - |
      Break your tyrant inhibitions
      as you haven't seen my ways and
      as you haven't seen the latest lies I understand
      and this vice is my way of life,
      my resurrection and my doom
      my feast and I leave this up to you so
    - |
      Wake up, wake up
      wake up to my taunting lie and then bring it around to something you understand
    - |
      Break the silence and call it off
      as you haven't been awaken
      as you haven't been away for long keep telling you to
      break the silence
      keep telling me your latest vice
      please tell it in a way that I can for once get it, I get it, I understand so
    - |
      Wake up, wake up
      wake to my taunting lie and then bring it around to something you understand.
    - |
      I wanna see it all for myself again
      give on to my arms
      give it up, give it up and shout it out!
      I wanna see it all for myself again
      give on to my arms
      give it up, give it up and shout it out!
