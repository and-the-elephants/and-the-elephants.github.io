    - |
      Records playback over faded
      trust unworthy silent pieces of reminiscence
      I was far from when you told me
      “stop this second this isn't mine to do again”
    - |
      Unfamiliar, unexpectedly worm
      this time isn't right
      but tonight you'll be fine in my
      trust unworthy comfortable
      previously staged and directed
      for my entertainment
    - |
      I don't want to be left aside
      I shall let you know again
      even if I don't remember anything
      this life is mine to do again
      I don't want to let go of your side
      this time I shall let know again
      even if you remember everything
      this life is mine to do again
    - |
      Visions playback over faded
      trust unworthy blurry glimpses of reminiscence
      unfamiliar, yet expectedly cold
      this place has no time
      but tonight you'll be fine in my
      trust unworthy comfortable
      previously staged and directed
      for your entertainment
    - |
      I don't want to be left aside
      I shall let you know again
      even if I don't remember anything
      this life is mine to do again
      I don't want to let go of your side
      this time I shall let know again
      even if you remember everything
      this life is mine to do again!
